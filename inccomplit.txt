- [ ] **EMAIL_PASSWORD**: Required for `skills/email_ops.py` (App Password recommended).
- [ ] **EMAIL_IMAP_SERVER**: Required for `skills/email_ops.py` (e.g., `imap.gmail.com`).

**How to Add:**
1. Open `.env` file: `/Users/ishitchaudhari/Desktop/JARVIC/.env`
2. Add the keys in the format shown in `remaining.txt`.

## 2. Incomplete Features / TODOs

- [ ] **Weather Skill**: Configuration required.

## 3. Python Dependencies
Ensure all dependencies are installed.
Run:

pip3 install requests
```
(Other dependencies like `pyttsx3`, `SpeechRecognition`, `groq` should already be installed).

## 4. Run Check
Run the following command to start JARVIS:
```bash
python3 main.py
```
If you see "JARVIS: Jarvis Online", everything is working.
